## Definition of the Plant breeding:

Plant breeding as a human endeavor **(çaba, uğraş, gayret)** has its origins in antiquity, starting off simply as discrimination among plant types to select and retain plants with the most desirable features. 

**<u> NOTE </u>** Plant breeding can broadly be defined as the improvement of the genetic patterns of domestic plant populations. Based on the importance of plants for human life, humans have been involved in manipulating and improving plants for their needs for more than 11 000 years.

## Aim of Plant Breeding:

+ Plant breeders have mainly been concerned with bringing about a continuous improvement in the productivity of that part of the plant which is of economic importance, the stability of production through in-built resistance to pests and diseases and nutritive and organoleptic or other desired quality characters.

+ Plants breeding aims to improve the characteristics of plants so that they become more desirable agronomically (tarımsal açıdan) and economically. 

**<u> NOTE </u>** In summary the aim of plant breeding is to produce disease-free, high-yielding, and early-maturing varieties of crops.

## Objective of plant breeding: 

+ **High primary productivity and efficient final production for each unit of cultivation and solar energy invested:** to ensure that all the light that falls on a fields is intercepted by lraves and that photosynthesis itself is as efficient as possible.

  + Greater efficiency in photosynthesis could perhaps be achieved by reducing photorespiration. 

+ **High crop yield:** Plants must be selected which invest a large proportion of their total primary productivity into those areas which are commercially desirable, e.g. seeds, roots,leaves or stems, grain (tahıl, granül), fodder, fibre,tuber, cane or oil depending upon the crop species. 

+ **Desirable nutritional value, organoleptic properties and processing qualities:** the proportion of essential amino acids and the total protein in cereal grains, for example, should be increased to improve their nutritional quality. 

+ **Biofortifying crops:** with essential mineral elements that are frequently lacking in the human diet such as Fe and Zn, vitamins and amino acids. 

+ **Modifying crop plants to generate plant derived pharmaceuticals** to supply low-cos grugs and vaccines to the developing world. 

+ **More extensive and efficient nitrogen fixation:** breeding cereals that encourage (teşvik etmek) the growth of increased numbers of nutrogen fixing microorganisms around their roots to reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizer. 

+ **More efficient use of water:** whether there is a plentiful supply or dearth of water.

+ **Insensitivity to photoperiod and temperature:** selection of the crop cultivars that are insensitive to photoperiod of temperature and characterized by a high per-day biomass production would allow the development of contingency cropping patterns to suit different weather probabilities. 

+ **Plant arcitecture and adaptability to mechanized farming:** The number and positioning of the leaves, branching pattern of the stem, the height of the plant, and the positioning of the organs to be harvested are all important to crop production and often determine how well plants can be harvested mechanically. 
+ **Elimination of toxic compounds:** it is essential to develop varieties free from toxic compounds in some crops to make them safe for human consumption. 

+ **The following items are also included in this topic:**

## Undesirable Effects

+ **Reduction in Diversity:** Modern improved varieties are more uniform than land races. Thus plant breeding leads to reduction in diversity. The uniform varieties are more prone to the new races of pathogen than land races which have high genetic diversity. 

+ **Narrow genetic base:** Uniform varieties have narrow genetic base. such varieties generally have poor adapability. 

+ **Danger of Uniformity:** Most of the improved varieties have some common parents in the pedigree which may cause danger of uniformity. 

+ **Undesirable Combinaitons:** Sometimes, plant breedings leads to undesirable combinaitons. The examples of man made crops having undesirable combinaiton of characters are *Raphanobrassice* and *Pomato*. 

## Molecular Plant Breeding

+ Plant breeders will be equipped with innovative approaches;

  + to identify/or create genetic variaiton,
  + to define the genetic feature of the genes related to the variations (position,function and relationship with other genes and environments), 
  + to understand the structure of breeding populations, 
  + to recombine novel alleles or allele combinaitons into specific cultivars or hybrids, 
  + to select the best individuals with desirable genetic features which enable them to adapt to a wide range of environments. 

+ DNA chips and other technologies are being developed to study the expression of multiple or even all genes simultaneously. 

+ With the advent of DN-based molecular markers, the extensive genetic mapping od chromosome become readily possible for a variety of species.

+ Several mechanisms for the de novo variation have been described, including intragenic recombianiton, unequal crossing over among repeated elements, transposon activity, DN Amethylation, and paramutation.

+ Another important feature in plant breeding whose molecular basis is not understood is `heterosis` although it is used as the basis for many seed-producing industries. 

+ `Genomics` and prticularly `transcriptomics` are now being used to identify the heterotic genes responsible for increasing crop yields (microarray and real time PCR)

+ **Genetic modification of crops** today involves the interfacing of molecular biology, cell and tissue culture, and genetics/breeding

  + The transfer of genes by cellular and molecular means will increase the available gene pool and lead to second generation biotechnology plant products such as those with a modified oil, protein, vitamin, or micronutrient content or those that have been engineered to produce compounds that can be used as vaccines or anticarcinogens.

## Duration and cost of plant breeding programs

+ It is estimated that i takes about 7-10 years (or even longer) to complete a breeding program for annual cultivars as corn, wheat, and soybeans, and much longer for tree crops. 

+ The use of molecular techniques to facilitate the section process may reduce the time for plant breeding in some cases. 

+ Genetically engineered parental stock attracts a steep fee to use beacuse of the costs involved in their creation. 

## Selected milenstones in plant breeding

+ **9000 BC:** First evidence of plant domestication in the hills above the tigris river

+ **3000 BC:** Domestication of all important food crops in the old world completed. 

+ **1000 BC:** Domesticaiton of all important food crops in the New World completed. 

+ **700 BC:** Assyrians and Babyloninas hand pollinate date palms.

+ **1719:** Fairchild created first artifical hybrid (carnationx sweet william)

+ **1934:** Dustin discovered `colchicines`

+ **1950:** McClintock discovered the Ac-Ds system of transposable elements. 

+ **1972:** Berg, Cohen, and boyer introduced the `recombinant DNA` technology. 

+ **1994:** `"FlavrSavr" tomato` developed as `first genetically modified food` produced for the market.

+ **1995:** Bt corn developed. 

<u> <p style="color:gold;">NOTE:</p> 

Bt corn is enhanced through biotechnology to protect against insect pests. Its built-in insect protection comes from a naturally occurring microorganism called Bacillus thuringiensis or “Bt.” The protein produced by Bt corn selectively targets caterpillars within the order of Lepidoptera. </u>

+ **1996-1997:** `Roundup Ready` soybean and wheat introduced

## Early Efforts at plant breeding

+ __Selective breeding;__ has been employed by early farmers to re-engineer plants to produce traits or qualities that were considered to be desirable to consumers. 
  + the best plants to provide seed for their next crop

  + Fİnd prolific or disease resisted plant and capture these desirable traits by corresponding them into other plants. 

+ __Domestication;__ modern plant breeding started with sedentary agriculture and the of domesticaiton the first agricultural plants, cereals.

+ __Artifical crosses;__ besides selecting plants with useful characteristic s breeders also arrange 'marriages' between plants with different traits in the hope of producing fertile offspring carrying both traits. 

+ __Hybridization;__ to be the important sources of new cultivars and stressed crossing of carefully selected parents to meet the aims of new cultivars.

## Doemsticaiton of the plant breeding

+ The process of bringing a wild species under human management is referred to as `domenstication`

  + The earliest records indicate that agriculture developed some 11,000 ears ago in the so-called *Fertile Crescent*.

+ Domesticaiton is a selection process carried out by man to adapt plants and animals to their own needs, wheteher as farmers or consumers. 

+ <u> Domestication is directed evolution; as a result, the process of evolution is accelerated. </u>

+ The key to domesticaiton is the selective advantage of rare mutant alleles
 which are desirable for saccesful cultivaiton but unnecessary for survival in the wild.

### Steps in the domestication process

+ Man not only planted seeds, but also:

  + `moved seeds from their native habitat` and planted them in areas to which the were perhaps not as well adapted. 

  + `Removed certain natural selection pressures by growing the plants` in a cultivated field. 

  + `applied artifical selection pressures` by choosing characteristics that would not necessarily have been benefical for the palnts under natural conditions. 

## Genetic engineering and gene transfer

+ The discovery of the structure of DNA has enhanced traditional breeding techniques by allowing breeders to pinpoint the particular gene responsible for a particular trait and to follow its transmission to subsequent generations. 

+ Enzymes that cut and rejoin DNA molecules allow scientists to manipulate genes in the laboratory. 

+ The goal of plant genetic engineers is to isolate one or more specific genes and introduce these into plants. 

+ DNA can also be introduced into cells by bombardment with DNA-coated particles or by `electroporation`.

## DNa markers and genomics

+ During the 1980s and 1990s, various types of molecular markers such as `restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)`, `Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)`, `microsatellites` and `Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)` were developed. 

+ Becuase of their abundance and importance in the plant genome, molecular markers have been widely used in the fields of germplasm evaluation, genetic mapping, map-based gene discovery and marker-assisted palnt breeding

+ Technological developments in bioinformatics, genomics and various omics fields are creating substantial data on which future revolutions in plant breeding can be based

## Base of plant breeding

+ Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection can be summed up in three principles that are at the core of plant breeding. These are the principles of:

  + **`variation`:** Variation in morphology, physiology, and behavior exist among individals in a natural population. 

    + There are various sources of genetic variation:

      + crossover, genetic drift and gene flow
      + Mutation (loss, addition, duplicaiton or rearrangement of whole chromosomes or chromosome segments)

  + **`Heredity`:** Offspring resemble their parents more than they resemble unrelated individuals.

  + **`Selection`:** Some individuals in a group are more capable of surviving and reproducing than others. 

<u> <p style="color: orange;">Recall</p>

<p style="color:yellow;">Genetic drift</p> is an evolutionary change in allelic frequencies of a population as a matter of chance. It occurs in very small populations, but its effects are strong. It occurs due to an error in selecting the alleles for the next generation from the gene pool of the current generation. It does not occur due to any environmental influences.

In large populations, the allele frequency of the genes remains relatively stable because the genes are not affecting fitness and do not have a natural selection pressure against the alleles. 

<p style="color:yellow;">The gene flow</p> is a popular and individual genetic material which transfers from one population to another. This involves different types of events such as pollen being driven to an entirely new destination or people migrating to a new place. If the versions of gene flow are carried to a population where the gene versions do not exist, it can be a major source of genetic variation. In the above image, the version of brown colouration shifts from one population to another.

Migration from one popular place to another is also responsible for a change in allele frequencies which covers a proportion of members to carry a particular variant of a gene. This immigration can also result in the addition of genetic variants to the established gene supply of one particular population. </u>

## Principles of breeding

+ **Inbreeding:** main goals of the inbreeding;

  + Increase the homozygosity at all or specific loci in the plant genome

  + produce a plant which breeds true

  + produce uniform plants

</p>

+ **Hybridization:** Hybridization occurs when inbreed parents are mated (cross pollinated)

  + creates heterozygous individual

  + increased heterosis (vigor) in F1 generation.

</p>

+ **Heterois (hybrid Vigor)** Heterosis occurs when two homozygous individuals are cross pollinated
  + This causes all loci to become heterozygous
  
  + The increased heterozygosity causes increased plant vigor

  + Benefits of Increased Vigor
  
    + Increased yield
    
    + Better standability
    
    + Better germination
    
    + Overall better plant performance
